3. Set the **Redirect URI** to `http://localhost:8888/callback` (or your preferred URI).
4. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 🛠 Usage

### Initial Setup
The first time you use the app, you must configure your credentials:
```bash
spotiStats --setup
```
This will prompt you for your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Redirect URI`. These are saved locally in `~/.config/spotistats/config.json`.

### View Monthly Stats (Default)
To see your stats from the **last 4 weeks**:
```bash
spotiStats
```

### View All-Time Stats
To see your **long-term** (several years) statistics:
```bash
spotiStats --global
```

### Update Credentials & Refresh Token
If your Spotify session expires, your refresh token is revoked, or you want to update your API keys:
```bash
spotiStats --update
# or
spotiStats -u
```
This will clear the cached authorization token (`~/.config/spotistats/.cache`) and prompt you to update your credentials in `config.json`.
